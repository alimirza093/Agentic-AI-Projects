# 🤖 Agentic-AI-Projects

This repository contains practice projects and experiments related to **Agentic AI** — a new approach to building AI systems that can **think, plan, and act like intelligent agents**.

---

## 🧠 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that act like autonomous agents.  
They can:

- Understand goals or instructions
- Plan steps to achieve them
- Interact with tools or APIs
- Adapt based on feedback

These agents use technologies like **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, **tools**, and **memory** to perform tasks with minimal human help.

## 📁 What’s Inside This Repo?

This repo includes:

- Example agents that can perform tasks
- Practice code to understand how agent loops work
- Basic projects combining LLMs with logic and planning

More projects will be added over time.
